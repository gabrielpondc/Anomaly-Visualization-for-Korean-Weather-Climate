ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a system, namely, the abnormal-weather monitoring and curation service (AWMC), which provides people with a better understanding of abnormal weather conditions. The service can analyze a set of multivariate weather datasets (i.e., 7 meteorological datasets from 18 cities in Korea) and show (i) which dates are mostly abnormal in a certain city, and (ii) which cities are mostly abnormal on a certain date. In particular, the dynamic graph-embedding-based anomaly detection method was employed to measure anomaly scores. We implemented the service and conducted evaluations. Regarding the results of monitoring abnormal weather, AWMC shows that the average precision was approximately 90.9%, recall was 93.2%, and F1 score was 92.1% for all the cities.},
